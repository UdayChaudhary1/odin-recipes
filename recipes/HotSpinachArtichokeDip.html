  <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
  <p>This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry â€” you'll never know they're in there! My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Cream cheese: This satisfying spinach artichoke dip starts with a block of cream cheese.</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise: Mayonnaise lends creaminess and a welcome tangy flavor.</li>
    <li>Cheeses: You'll need grated Parmesan, grated Romano, and shredded mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Garlic: A clove of minced garlic takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: The spinach artichoke dip is seasoned with dried basil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Artichoke hearts: Drain and chop one can of artichoke hearts.</li>
    <li>Spinach: Thawed and drained frozen spinach is perfect for this easy recipe.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix all the ingredients (except for the mozzarella) together.</li>
    <li>Transfer the mixture to a prepared baking dish. Top with cheese.</li>
